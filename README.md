mapagent-dotnet-sample
======================

This is a sample asp.net (4.0) project demonstrating the use of MgHttpRequest/MgHttpResponse classes in the MapGuide API to allow you to have your own custom mapagent http handler that does not require Apache or IIS.

This project requires Visual Studio 2012 Express for Web and MapGuide Open Source 2.4 (any bitness will do). The project has already been configured to auto-fetch the matching mapguide binaries from NuGet
